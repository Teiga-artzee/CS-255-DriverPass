# CS-255-DriverPass
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a business that is trying to fill the gap in the market for those who are trying to learn driver
safety as well as how to drive and take the DMV tests. They wanted to create an online website system where
their customers could create profiles, purchase packages that would allow them to schedule in person driving 
instructions, as well as take lessons and practice tests.

What did you do particularly well?

In this project, the business requirements document was in depth and provided an excellent basis for what
the project would need moving forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The UML Diagrams could be improved with further information and organized better. Designing UML's take time,
practice, and a full understanding of the system for proper development. In time, there would be several
iterations of these UML's before they would have been accepted for further use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Understanding the users needs, it helped understand what the system would need to do and how it should behave.
This was understood when creating the UML diagrams, the usecases, the users who would interact with the system,
and in designing the flow of specific use cases in the activity diagrams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, the best strategy and technique would be to understand the fundamental purpose of the system
being created in order to ensure that the user requirements meet  this overarching goal. Working will the user to
develop these requirements in many steps of the design process, will help  uncover any functionality that may have 
been missed prior.
